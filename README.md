## Features

- Basic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Scientific Functions:
  -  Trigonometric functions: sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan).
  - Degree and Radian Mode: By default, trigonometric calculations are in radian mode. You can switch to degree mode by clicking the "deg" button, but it will then toggle to "rad" in GUI.
  - Other scientific operations include logarithms, powers, factorial, exponential, and square roots.
- Keyboard Support: Input numbers and functions using either the on-screen buttons or your keyboard.
- Clear and Reset: Use the clear (AC) button to reset the current calculation and start fresh.
  

## How to Use
